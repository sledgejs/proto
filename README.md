# Sledge Prototype (Draft)
This repository is a prototype for the framework which will be named Sledge in the future.
It is organized as a boilerplate on top of which front-end applications can be built.
The goal of Sledge is to offer a set of concepts and utilities which solve real-world situations 
and problems which usually arise in large front-end applications.
